# Kretes in 5 minutes

The video below shows how to create a **full-stack** web application in TypeScript using Kretes in about 5 minutes. This doesn't mean 5 minutes is enough to create a web application using Kretes in general - the video was edited for conciseness. The intention is to provide a dense introduction showing what's possibe in Kretes and how it can help you be more productive when creating web applications in TypeScript.

## Specification

In the video we are building a task management application using TypeScript with the following characteristics:
* Node.js on back-end
* Vue.js 3 on front-end.
* PostgreSQL as a persistence layer
* TypeScript on back-end & front-end
* Nix for managing external dependencies (e.g. a database engine).

Finally, please remember: this project is in **alpha stage**.
