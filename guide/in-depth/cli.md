## Commands

### `new` - Create a New Project

`kretes new` generates a project structure for a Kretes application.

### `start` - Start the Application

`kretes start` starts the application in development mode. This command must be run from the project directory generated by `kretes new`. The application will be available at [localhost:5544](http://localhost:5544).

### `add` - Add the package as project dependency

`kretes add` adds a package from the NPM registry as the project dependency by modifying `package.json`. This is a convenience wrapper around `pnpm add`.

### `install` - Install Dependencies

`kretes install` installs the application dependencies as specified in `package.json`. This is a convenience wrapper around `pnpm install`.

### `update` - Update Dependencies

`kretes update` updates the application dependencies. Updating only changes the minor and patch versions in the lock file (`pnpm-lock.yaml`). This is a convenience wrapper around `pnpm update`.

### `upgrade` - Upgrade Dependencies

`kretes upgrade` upgrades the application dependencies. This comamnd checks if there are new versions of packages in the npm registery as defined in `package.json`. Upgrading changes `package.json`.
