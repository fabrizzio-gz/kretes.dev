# Setting up React.js

[React.js](https://reactjs.org/) is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces. React.js combined with Kretes allows to quickly build **full-stack** TypeScript applications.

## Install React.js

**Reminder:** Kretes uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/) instead of npm or yarn.

As of *Aug, 2020* React.js does not provide ESM build. We will use [pika]'s fork that provides actively maintained ESM builds of React & React DOM.

```
pnpm add react@npm:@pika/react react-dom@npm:@pika/react-dom @types/react @types/react-dom
```

## TypeScript Configuration

In `config/client/tsconfig.json` add the following options under the `compilerOptions` so that there won't be any errors for the JSX syntax:

```json
"jsx": "react"
```

## Init Script

In `config/client/index.html`, just before the closing `</body>` tag, add the init script pointing to `config/client/index.tsx`:

```html
  ...
  <script type="module" src="/config/client/index.tsx"></script>
</body>
```

In `config/client` rename `index.ts` to `index.tsx` if you plan to use the JSX syntax.

Inside `config/client/index.tsx` put the following initialization script:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { render } from "react-dom";

import { App } from 'Base/View';

render(<App />, document.getElementById('app')!);
```

## Create `App` Component

Let's create a simple component that says *Hello* to a fixed name (set in the application state).

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('Zaiste');

  return (
    <div className="max-w-2xl mx-auto">
      <div className="p-4 bg-white shadow">
        Hello, <span className="font-semibold">{name}</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export { App };
```


## REST Endpoint

Kretes is all about building full-stack applications in TypeScript. Let's create a REST endpoint that returns a name and let's connect it with our `App` component to dynamically display it.

In `features/Base/Controller` create `browse.ts`. The naming is important. The `browse` name corresponds to the HTTP `GET` request that is supposed to respond with a collection of a given resource. In this case for simplicity reasons, we will return a collection of one element - a hash with the `name` key and a random name as its value.

```tsx
import { Handler, response } from 'kretes';

const { OK } = response;

const names = [ 'Rick Deckard', 'Harry Bryant', 'Roy Batty', 'Dr. Eldon Tyrell', 'Hannibal Chew',
  'Niander Wallace', 'Taffey Lewis', 'Dave Holden', 'Ana Stelline', 'Leon Kowalski'];

export const browse: Handler = ({ params }) => {
  const nameAtRandom = names[Math.floor(Math.random() * names.length)];

  return OK({ name: nameAtRandom });
}

```

We create a handler function that describes the action that will happen once such request is received. In Kretes, handlers are functions that take HTTP requests as input and return HTTP responses as output. The `OK` convenience wrapper corresponds to the `200 OK` response. We define the list of names in memory for convenience, as the `names` variable.

## Data Fetching

We can now connect the front-end with the REST endpoint using the `useEffect` hook and the built-in `fetch` browser API. In the `App` component function just after `useState` add the following piece of code

```tsx
function App() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');

  const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/base');
    const { name } = await response.json();
    setName(name);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData();
  }, [])

  ...
}
```

## Result

ðŸŽ‰ Congrats! You built a simple, but still full-stack TypeScript application using React.js and Node.js. Did you notice there's no Webpack or Rollup setup needed? It works out-of-the-box with **zero configuration**. That's cool, isn't?

Here's the [source code](https://github.com/kreteshq/react-kretes-setup-example) for this application
